**reproducible research** is the ability to recompute data analytic results, given an observed data set and knowledge of the data analysis pipeline.

# reproducible research


---
class: middle

**reproducibility for scientific reasons**

* increased trustworthiness
* more rigorous, reliable science
* learning more from one another's work

# reproducibility for science

class: middle

**reproducibility for personal reasons**

- helps researchers remember how and why they did *x*
- enables researchers to quickly and simply modify figures, tables, etc.
- enables quick reconfiguration of previously conducted research tasks

most basic principle for reproducible research: **do everything via code**

* downloading data from the web
* converting an Excel file to CSV
* renaming columns or variables
* omitting bad samples or data points

*...do all of these programmatically*

# why publish data

* big picture
  + increasingly a requirement
  + advancement of science
  
* researcher perspective
  + papers with publicly available data receive a higher number of citations than similar studies lacking available data<sup>1</sup>
  + data sharing is associated with higher productivity
  + a citeable product
